*Let Scout be your Preservation Guide*

What Is Scout?
--------------
Scout is a preservation watch system being developed within the SCAPE project. It provides an ontological knowledge base to centralize all necessary information to detect preservation risks and opportunities. It uses plugins to allow easy integration of new sources of information, as file format registries, tools for characterization, migration and quality assurance, policies, human knowledge and others. The knowledge base can be easily browsed and triggers can be installed to automatically notify users of new risks and opportunities. Examples of such notification could be: content fails to conform to defined policies, a format became obsolete or new tools able to render your content are available.

In short, Scout is a web-based service which:

* provides an ontological knowledge base for compiling the information needed to detect preservation risks and opportunities
* assists content holders in monitoring their digital repository
* enables content holders to monitor changes in the preservation environment that can influence their own preservation setup
* provides notification about, for example, format obsolescence, new preservation tools, and policy conformity

What Can Scout Do For Me?
-------------------------
Finding out when and how your digital content is at risk is a hard and heavy task to do alone. 
Many repositories have similar content and are facing similar preservation issues, but they don’t have the means to help each other preserve their content and discover synergies in an easy way, beyond informal community interaction.

Scout helps you to:

* discover who else is holding content of a specific type (file format)
* know whether your repository is the only one using a specific preservation tool
* know, for instance, how many organisations use Fedora Commons version 3.4
* be able to reduce risks by community engagement and assistance

Scout Can Be Used By
--------------------

* **Content holders**: academic and national libraries, archives, galleries, museums
* **Preservation experts**

How can you engage with Scout?

* Access Scout – get access to the community knowledge
* Create a content profile – monitor your collections
* Share your content profile – join the community and discover synergies
* Define your interests – be notified about opportunities and risks
